This my first task at Kalbonian Almarsous competition for programming 
I build responsive website with pure HTML, CSS, little Javascript from scratch
Didn't use any library or frame work 
It was an exercise after the responsive HTML, csscouse I studied through Udemy platform 
Hope the project help any one on his small steps through his journey of learning web development
